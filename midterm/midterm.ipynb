    "### Mid-term Exam Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is designed to help you build several databases for your major research projects. These codes should give you a detailed indication on how to combine and clean common financial databases for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be looking at six databases: \n",
    "Accounting data from annual reports, \n",
    "Stock returns data from stock exchanges, \n",
    "Analyst reports, \n",
    "CEO characteristics from proxy statements, \n",
    "Board data from proxy statements, and \n",
    "Firm's patent grants from patent office\n",
    "\n",
    "To make these databases manageable, I will be using data from 2007 to 2017, 10 years US data, for illustration. For your research project, it is more than enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "These datas are all available via WRDS, feel free to download them if you need more of them. I will point out where to download. For our convenience, I have downloaded them already and converted them into a binary format called parquet. It helps pandas read in the data more quickly and enables us to select the columns before reading the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips before you begin:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Go back through the videos from week 1, week 2 and week 3 if you get stuck on anything. All of the tools required to complete this task have been already taught, you should be able to recognise which tools to use. If you cannot remember how to perform a certain task in pandas, go through the videos until you find the solution, or search it up on google.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Google is your best friend! Search up anything that you are still stuck with, and make sure that you are able to fully understand and explain what each function does that allows you to perform your required task.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) I want you to demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of python. Put in comments in your code to explain what you have done in each step, present it clearly and imagine you are showing this code to someone with absolutely no knowledge of python. You want them to understand what it is you have done.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) There will be cells that show the solutions for these tasks. Only use these if you are completely stuck. Avoid directly copying the code from the solution into your answer. You should try to run the code first, and continue to try and try again until you get the code to run properly. Then, I will recommend you check your code with the solutions after you are confident that your code is working.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Good luck!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: for any Mac users who are struggling to access Jupyter Notebook on their computer, here are the instructions to open Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the midterm.ipynb zip on GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Expand the zip on your desktop and place file on desktop\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Go into terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Type pip install anaconda in terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "5. After anaconda is installed, type jupyter notebook in terminal. This will take you to a web server where you can access the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Open the midterm.ipynb code from your desktop and the mfin6210-master file."
